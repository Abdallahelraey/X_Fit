1. **Initial Assessment:**
   - Conduct a thorough initial assessment, considering fitness goals, medical history, current fitness level, and any preferences or constraints.

2. **Goal Setting:**
   - Define specific and realistic fitness goals with the customer.

3. **Duration and Intensity:**
   - Determine the duration of the phase (e.g., 6-8 weeks) and the appropriate intensity level (e.g., low, moderate, high).

4. **Exercise Selection:**
   - Customize the phase by selecting exercises that align with the customer's goals and initial assessment.
   - Consider flexibility, core stability, balance, resistance, and other relevant components.

5. **Training Parameters:**
   - Utilize a structured approach to define training parameters for each type of training (e.g., reps, sets, tempo, intensity, rest, schedule, frequency, volume, split, duration).

6. **Plan Implementation:**
   - Implement a logic or plan within the respective method (e.g., `plan` method) to organize exercise selection, workout structure, and progression strategies.

7. **Communication with the Customer:**
   - Clearly communicate the phase plan to the customer, explaining the chosen exercises and parameters.
   - Provide instructions for performing exercises, emphasizing proper form and technique.

8. **Progress Tracking:**
   - Implement logic to track the customer's progress during the phase (e.g., `evaluate_progress` method).
   - Encourage the customer to log workouts and provide feedback for ongoing adjustments.

9. **Adaptations and Progression:**
   - Define phase-specific adaptations and progression strategies based on fitness principles and the customer's progress (e.g., `adaptations` and `progression_methodology` methods).

10. **Summary and Feedback:**
    - Provide a summary of the phase, highlighting its focus and benefits.
    - Encourage regular communication with the customer for feedback and adjustments.

Remember we aim to tailor each phase to the individual needs of the customer, considering their specific goals, preferences, and limitations. Flexibility in adapting the plan based on progress and feedback is key to a successful and satisfying fitness journey.
